Angular Data Binding Project
This project demonstrates the essential concept of data binding in Angular, a mechanism that enables communication between the component (logic) and the template (UI). It allows developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications with ease.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Data Binding in Angular
1. Interpolation
Description: Used to display component data in the HTML template.

Real-time Example: Displaying a userâ€™s name or a product title on a webpage.

2. Property Binding
Description: Binds component data to the properties of HTML elements.

Real-time Example: Dynamically setting the image source or disabling a button based on a condition.

3. Event Binding
Description: Used to handle user actions such as clicks, input, or keypress events.

Real-time Example: Submitting a form when a button is clicked or responding to a userâ€™s keystroke.

4. Two-Way Data Binding
Description: Combines property and event binding to sync data between the component and the template in real-time.

Real-time Example: Typing in a search box and instantly seeing filtered results, or filling a form where inputs are reflected in the component model.
